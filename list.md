#### CY 4760/6760: Security of Wireless and Mobile Systems (4 credits)
[:book:](./courses/NUCY4760.pdf)

*Offered Spring 2023* 

Description: This course focuses on Security and Privacy in Mobile and Wireless Systems. Recent years have seen massive deployment of wireless devices and technologies around us. They are deployed in a wide variety of systems such as telephony, navigation, sensor networks, critical infrastructures etc. With the advent of the Internet of Things and autonomous cyber-physical systems, the proliferation of these wireless systems is only bound to increase. The broadcast nature of wireless technologies and the increased availability of software defined radios have not only improved quality of life but pose significant security challenges. 

This course provides the foundations to understand the security and privacy threats and defenses in wireless and mobile systems especially in the era of softwarization of wireless networks. After this course, the students should be able to describe and classify security goals and attacks in modern wireless networks. They should be able to identify the unique security implications of these effects and how to mitigate security issues associated with them. 

Prerequisites: None 

 

#### CY 4930: Cybersecurity Capstone (4 credits)
[:book:](./courses/NUCY4930.pdf)

*Offered Spring 2023* 

Description: Provides the culmination of the learned principles and methodologies for identifying and addressing Cybersecurity issues in organizations. Students bring their individual skills and abilities to create a solution to a real-world cybersecurity problem/challenge. Students will work in small groups to identify and scope the information security problem/challenge, create a project plan to develop a solution to include the development and identification of the data necessary to properly solve the problem/challenge, develop a final report (whose intended audience are senior business executives) and participate in the MSCY Capstone Event to present the results they have obtained. Further the students will be required to manage and develop the project using some SCRUM methodology tools. In this way, sprints will be planned for each project and the team will deliver the product after each sprint iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback. 


#### CHNS 1101: Elementary Chinese 1 (4 credits)
[:book:](./courses/NUCHNS1101.pdf)

*Offered Fall and Spring* 

Description: This course is designed for students with little or no prior knowledge of Chinese. With its holistic focus on the four language skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing, the course helps students build a solid foundation in language form and accuracy, and prepares them to function in a Chinese language environment. Students will learn not only how the Chinese language works grammatically, but will also learn to use Chinese in real life. 

 

Prerequisites: None
